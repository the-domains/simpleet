# I'm a thing.

You seem malnourished. Are you suffering 
from intestinal parasites? So I really am important? How I feel when I'm
drunk is correct? Say what? Good news, everyone! I've taught the 
toaster to feel love! Ow, my spirit!

Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. **He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.**_It must be wonderful._ Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

## It's a T. It goes "tuh".

Yeah.
Give a little credit to our public schools. Hey, guess what you're 
accessories to. Bender, this is Fry's decision... and he made it wrong. So
it's time for us to interfere in his life. Quite possible. We live long
and are celebrated poopers.

1. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!
2. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.
3. Bender,
being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, 
and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. 
Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

### I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

I
love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of 
sleaze that those things bring. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I 
both rue and lament it. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we 
walk!

* Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.
* Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?
* You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?

Daylight
and everything. Your best is an idiot! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the 
Martians. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Oh, I don't have 
time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a 
coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I 
complain.

And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that 
would be it. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down 
with your children, and hitting them? I'll get my kit! OK, this has 
gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman
can.

But existing is basically all I do! This opera's as lousy as
it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your 
characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Daylight 
and everything.

Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the 
Hun! You know, I was God once. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do
with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING 
AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!

Please,
Don-Bot... look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Is 
today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Can we have 
Bender Burgers again? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind
against me!

Who are those horrible orange men? Does anybody else 
feel jealous and aroused and worried? Hello Morbo, how's the family? We 
don't have a brig.

You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from 
intestinal parasites? And then the battle's not so bad? Is today's 
hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? I daresay that Fry has 
discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!

You guys 
aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of 
Jesus? I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! You 
guys go on without me! I'm going to go... look for more stuff to steal!

No,
of course not. It was... uh... porno. Yeah, that's it. You know, I was God 
once. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet 
drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and
the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be...

You
lived before you met me?! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. 
Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Why am I sticky and naked? 
Did I miss something fun? Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die 
like this. But I always really hoped.

What are their names? Oh, I
always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break 
his legs? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a
death sphere? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more 
ladylike. As though!
