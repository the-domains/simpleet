 Give a little credit to our public schools. Hey, guess what you're

would be it. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down 
with your children, and hitting them? I'll get my kit! OK, this has 
gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman
 can.</p><p>But existing is basically all I do! This opera's as lousy as
 it is brilliant!  Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your 
characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Daylight 
and everything.</p><p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the 
Hun! You know, I was God once. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do
 with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING 
AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p><p>Please,
 Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Is 
today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Can we have 
Bender Burgers again? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind
 against me!</p><p>Who are those horrible orange men? Does anybody else 
feel jealous and aroused and worried? Hello Morbo, how's the family? We 
don't have a brig.</p><p>You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from 
intestinal parasites? And then the battle's not so bad? Is today's 
hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? I daresay that Fry has 
discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p><picture>

<p>You guys 
aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of 
Jesus? I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! You 
guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!</p><p>No,
 of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. You know, I was God 
once. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet 
drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and
 the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</p><p>You
 lived before you met me?! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. 
Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Why am I sticky and naked? 
Did I miss something fun? Goodbye, friends.  I never thought I'd die 
like this.  But I always really hoped.</p><p>What are their names? Oh, I
 always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break 
his legs? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a
 death sphere? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more 
ladylike. As though!</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="24"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="26"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="27"><span data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="30"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="31">I&#x27;m a thing.</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="34"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
